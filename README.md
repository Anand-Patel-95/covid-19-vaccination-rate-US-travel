# Studying the Effect of Covid-19 Vaccination Rate on Travel in U.S. West Coast Counties

- Discovered Covid-19 vaccination rates along the U.S. West Coast counties in California, Oregon, and Washington pre-summer 2021 had a statistically insignificant impact on summer travel there using OLS regression analysis in R on data aggregated from the CDC, NYT, and Census. 

- Advised tourism boards of California, Oregon, and Washington on actions to accomodate our observed trends in traveling citizens.
